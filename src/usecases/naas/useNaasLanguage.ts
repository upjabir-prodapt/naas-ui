 * shape rather than the standalone naas app's original LanguageContext.
 * Each screen that needs it (NaasChatScreen, NaasAgentScreen) calls this
 * independently; both read/write the same localStorage key and i18n
 * instance, so they stay in sync across a full page navigation the same
 * way the old Context-backed value did — the only difference is there's no
 * live cross-component sync within a single render tree, which neither
 * screen ever needed simultaneously (only one is ever mounted at a time).
